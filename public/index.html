            <p>SmartLocket is an NFC-powered keepsake that lets you save and relive your most meaningful moments with
                just one tap. Instead of endless photos, SmartLocket focuses on what truly matters — a small,
                intentional collection of 3–5 memories that define your story.

                Tap your SmartLocket and instantly open a private memory page in your browser. No apps. No clutter. Just
                the moments you chose.</p>
